**spent** allows you to easily track your spending, helping you save some cash.

##The Questions

###What language, library, feature, service or tool does this example demonstrate?
This example demonstrates a doughnut chart from Chart.js. 

###Why would a web developer use this technology?
This library was easy to use and the documentation was very clear. This library would be a good choice for a web developer who would need to make a good looking and responsive chart in a short amount of time. 

###Why might a web developer be cautious about using this technology? 
If the project required a lot of data, interaction, transformation the web developer might want to use a heavier charting library. Most of the examples on the chart.js site were simple and the 'Advanced usage' methods were pretty limited.

###What limitations, weaknesses, or drawbacks does this technology have? 
Their documentation was easy to read but did not see very complete. It makes me assume that this library is mainly for projects that are straight-forward.

###Does it have an active development community or does it look abandoned? 
The community appears to be pretty lively! There were a lot of results when I typed "chart.js" into google. They even have an angular-chart.js and a react-chart.js so that was a good sign. 

###How many projects seem to use this technology? 
I am not sure how many projects use chart js but there are a few tutorials on how to use chart js online.

###If there is a public GitHub repo for this, when was the last commit, how many open issues do they have, and are those issues being addressed?
There is a public GitHub repo for this. The last commit was on November 16, 2015. It currently has 394 open issues and 18 pull requests. Compared with d3's 180 issues and 68 pull requests, this makes me a little worried.

###What is your example site/app and how does it demonstrate the value of your chosen technology?
My example application is a spending tracker. You type in the amount you spent along with the category and subcategory (location and description are optional) and it will track and visualize how much money you have spent. Chart.js's doughnut chart makes it easy to see where most of your money goes.

###How should someone run your example?
Check it out [here](http://enamarkovic.com/info343/challenges/spent/).

Type in the amount of money spent, pick a category, and then pick a subcategory based on the category. You may enter in location and/or description as well but these fields are optional. Hit "Add" and the chart will update based on the amount you entered. To see more details on a category, just click the one you want and the chart will re-draw to show you the subcategories within that category. If you click on a subcategory, a list of the transactions will appear below the chart (might have to scroll down on smaller screens). To go back to the category display, just click in the middle on the chart.

###Where should a web developer go to learn more about this technology? Include links to getting started guides, tutorials, articles, or other examples that you found.
I just went to their [website] (http://www.chartjs.org/). There you can find their [documentation] (http://www.chartjs.org/docs/). I followed the left menu to the "Pie & Doughnut Carts" section.
Their documnetation was very easy to follow so I did not find a need for other tutorials, articles or examples.
